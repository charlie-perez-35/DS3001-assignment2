        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "  This paper is about a framework for cleaning data called tidying. Tidying involves simplifying uncleaned data into tables with variables x and observations y, creating easy-to-manipulate and consistent observational units.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The tidy data standard is intended to provide a standardized method for cleaning data, simplifying the data cleaning process and facilitating translation between the data and data manipulation tools. This enables the data scientist to spend less time on cleaning and more time on analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  First sentence: Tidy datasets have the same characteristics, so tools and functions can operate on different datasets to find meaning in the same way. Messy datasets may have different quirks, so writing functions to operate on messy datasets or cleaning them has to be done differently with each new dataset -- nothing works the same way twice.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Second sentence: The same idea as the first -- when you can generalize a function to operate on many datasets, you can accomplish a great deal more analysis in the same amount of time. However, this generalization can prove exceptionally challenging when no two datasets are quite alike, and you must examine each dataset to learn its quirks.\n",

        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Values: the individual items that make up the dataset, variables, and observations, typically quantitative (int) or qualitative (str).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Variables: organized based on a particular underlying attribute. Contains multiple values, all of which represent a particular unit's corresponding attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Observations: organized based on individual units being measured. Contains multiple values, all of which when combined make up every attribute for which the individual unit has a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Each variable makes a column, each observation makes a row, and each observational unit (such as a study) forms a table. In the ordering, fixed (known beforehand) variables should come before measured variables, with the ordering of the first variable dictating the ordering of the observations and connected variables appearing next to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  5 most common problems with messy datasets: (1) column headers are values, not variable names, (2) multiple variables stored in one column, (3) variables stored in both rows and columns, (4) multiple observational units in one table, (5) single observational unit in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why Table 4 is messy: The variables are 'religion', 'income', and 'frequency', so it breaks (1).\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"Melting': Turning columns containing values into rows, or \"stacking\". This process is ordered based on a column that is already a variable, or \"colvar\".\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because the d1 etc. columns are part of the 'date' variable, which is also stored in two different columns, and the variables tmax and tmin are stored in the same column. The first problem is rectified in Table 12a, and the second is rectified in Table 12b.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tidy data is only useful if you have tools designed to interact with it; because data and tools are constantly evolving, it is difficult to coordinate tidy data with tidy tools so that the tidy data framework is actually useful. Wickham hopes that at some point, it is possible to create tidy tools for dealing with multidimensional arrays, or even tidy tools that can interpret data in any form and automatically choose between dataframe-tidy and array-tidy formats."
